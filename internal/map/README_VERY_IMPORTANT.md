in order to achieve the curvature shader effect of going downhill every mesh
that exists im the map has to use the "hill_material.tres" shader

you shouldnt have to worry about the curvature while making assets, just
make sure that the models are at least moderatly dense in vertexes

with some singleton and global shader params magic curvature can be adjusted in
runtime
